1. importing tkinter: This line imports the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. We alias it as tk for convenience.

2. creating calculator class:
              * Class Definition:
                         The Calculator class encapsulates the functionality and UI of our calculator.
                         Initialization (__init__): This method is called when an instance of the class is created. It sets up the main window (root) and gives it a title.

3. setting up display: 
        * Entry Widget:
                This creates a text box where the user can see their input and results. Itâ€™s styled with a specific width, font, and border.
         * Grid Layout:
                    The display is placed in the first row and spans across four columns.

4. creating button: 
           * Button Labels: 
                     A list of button labels is defined for the digits, operations, and functions (clear and equals).

5. layout for button:  
           * Button Creation:
                        A loop iterates over the buttons list to create a button for each label.
           * Button Properties:
                        Each button is given a width, height, font, and a command that calls the on_button_click method when pressed.
                        Grid Placement: The buttons are placed in a grid, adjusting the row and column values for layout.

6. button click handler:
                   * Handling Clicks:
                             This method is called whenever a button is pressed.
                   * Clear Button (C):
                             If the clear button is pressed, the display is cleared.
                   * Equals Button (=):
                              When pressed, the input is evaluated using eval(), which computes the expression. If successful, the result is displayed; if an error occurs (e.g., division by zero), "Error" is shown.
                              Appending Input: For other buttons, their value is appended to the display
7. main execution:
             * Main Program:
                      This checks if the script is being run directly.
            * Creating Tkinter Window:
                           A new Tkinter window (root) is created.
            * Instantiate Calculator:
                         An instance of the Calculator class is created, passing the root.
                         Start the GUI Loop: mainloop() keeps the application running, waiting for user interaction.
8. summary:
         This code creates a simple calculator with a user interface where users can input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations.
         The use of classes allows for better organization and encapsulation of the functionality.
         You can expand this basic version with additional features, improve the UI, or refine the error handling to make it more robust.
